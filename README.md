# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Professor who teaches networking at both Seneca College and Centennial College.  I have taught courses in the following areas: Linux, Web Design, Cisco.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating Introduction to Web Design (at Centennial College) to use AWS, GitHub and Visual Studio Code. 

I'm loving the workflow in VS Code (I used Notepad ++ for a long time as an editor for html, css and other languages). It's great having native support VS Code in my operating system, as I my desktop runs Linux Mint (yes, I'm old school and have a desktop). Also, GitHub Codespaces are amazing. Check them out! It's VS Code running on a container, and accessible in your browser. Want to edit from your phone or tablet while on public transit? No problem.

Outside of work (when I have time for such things) I love gaming and heavy metal; in no particular order. I have a Wordpress blog that I haven't updated in almost a decade. One of these days I should get around to that.
