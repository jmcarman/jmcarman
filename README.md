# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Professor who teaches networking at both Centennial College and Seneca College.  I have taught courses in the following areas: Linux, AWS, Web Design, Cisco, Windows, MS Office.

🔭 I'd tell you, but then...

I updated Introduction to Web Design (at Centennial College) in summer 2023 to use AWS, GitHub and Visual Studio Code. I'm loving the workflow in VS Code (I used Notepad ++ for a long time as an editor for html, css and other languages). It's great having native support VS Code in my operating system, as my desktop runs Linux Mint (yes, I'm old school and have a desktop). Also, GitHub Codespaces are amazing. Check them out! It's VS Code running on a container, and accessible in your browser. Want to edit from your phone or tablet while on public transit? No problem.

Outside of work (when I have time for such things) I love gaming and heavy metal; in no particular order. I have a Wordpress blog that I haven't updated in almost a decade. One of these days I should get around to that.
